Banksim Project:

This is a project created for a Computer Science Data Structures class, where the goal was to determine
which amount of tellers (1,2,3...,9,10) would produce the fastest and most cost-efficient processing time.
If the teller amount is too low, then the processing time required is too lengthy. If the teller amount
is too high, then the extra tellers do not contribute to lowering the processing time. Each patron has
a pre-determined arrival time and processing time that affects the program, and the software keeps track
of the total global time as well. From the program, it is clear that desirable teller amount is 8.
